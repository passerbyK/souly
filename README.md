At Souly, we are an online drawing platform where you can express your creativity by drawing based on prompts generated by our system. You can view your drawing history on your personal page and connect with friends to see their artwork !

## Project Description

1. Website Description:

- SOULY is an art platform that places emphasis on the "accumulation" of artistic value. We advocate for sustained engagement in a 21-day activity, aiming to cultivate habits and progressively develop into a professional artist. The primary activity on our platform is drawing, with users creating artwork based on daily themes generated by the system. Through this creative process, we are committed to accumulating skills while reflecting an individual's keen awareness of life and unique preferences.

2. Website Usage:

- Start by registering and accessing the "Painting Page" to draw. You can view your drawing records on the "Personal Page" and appreciate friends' artwork on the "Social Page."
- Adjust your own themes and target days in the "Settings" section.
- Visit the "About Us" page to learn about the origins of our platform.
